## General Notice
Please read everything below to ensure both you and those you game with are having a fun and fair experience on Epona. The below applies to ALL eponians whether new or old and has been voted on and will be enforced by the Epona community. Efforts will be made to assist new players in learning the below rules. Please keep in mind this is a living document and therefore is subject to change. While you can have a great experience on Epona without reading through all of these guidelines and just "go with the flow," it is recommended to become familiar with this document in the event a question comes up. Always good to be prepared!

## Important Notice
Sometimes situations can occur that are not described in the rule document. If there is disagreement during any boss or during the rolls or any other situation in Epona, a solution can be made with common sense and/or a server vote. The normal rules for a server vote apply. These situations will be solved on a case-by-case basis and have no impact on any following case in terms of enforcing past solutions. They can be used as a reference point, but force by no means that the same actions need to be taken. Every situation is different; therefore, all situations not listed in the rule document are solved on a case-by-case basis.

## About Epona
Epona is a famously free server. We get a lot of transfers from other servers, so to ensure that players have an adequate knowledge of the rules, we've written this guide. We are able to progress through the game because the many clans work together as a team. How does Epona work?

1. Epona runs on a roll-based system, meaning all players roll the dice to determine who wins the drops. This is essentially a lottery system. Anyone is allowed to participate in this system provided they abide by the rules listed in this document.  
2. The community holds the power on this server, not just clan chiefs or gens (Clan Leaders). This means that what you say matters. Speak to someone in-game to be invited to our Discord (third-party chat app) chat rooms and get your voice heard.  
3. Everything you are currently reading was voted on by the Epona community and said community is responsible for enforcing it. The community has the authority to override any of these rules should it deem it necessary by means of a vote.  
4. People here like how we operate; we see it as a fair way to play, so rules were created to reduce players with ill intentions from getting to end game. Even end game players can be banned if they refuse to follow the server's rules.  
5. Players who won't play by our rules receive server bans, meaning they will not be able to participate at bosses and progress through the game.  
6. Most bosses are fairly hard and cannot be downed without the help of those in the community. Therefore winning drops while banned is nearly impossible.  
7. Loot you have won can be sold for in-game currency (gold). Some clans have restrictions for their members, so it is good to research and ask the clan before joining.  

## General Rules
Below you will find a summary of the rules that you have to comply with. Further below in this document, you will find extra information regarding subjects like voting or bossing.

1. Epona is full of all kinds of players. Please be respectful to all ages, races, religions, and genders. 
   - 1.1. Extreme rudeness/insulting can result in a server ban if agreed on by the majority of the community. 
   - 1.2. Repeat offenders will be perma-banned. 
   - 1.3. Treat others how you would like to be treated.  
   - 1.4. Racial, derogatory, and homophobic insults and slurs will result in a temporary ban, the length of which will be decided by a server discussion and/or majority vote with a maximum of one year.  
   - 1.5. Repeated and/or excessive remarks may result in a permanent ban.  
2. Follow ALL bossing rules listed below.
3. **Botting:** 
   - 3.1. 3 months for first offense.  
   - 3.2. Permanent ban for subsequent offenses.  
4. Selling your account will result in your toon being permanently server banned and will be reported directly to the DECA support team. 
   - 4.1. **Account Trading/Sharing:** Remains a permanent ban for first offense due to the threat to the rolling system.  
5. **IRL Trading:** This only applies in Epona: 
   - 5.1. Any SS showing an advertisement to buy or sell gold or gears will result in an instant perm ban that can't be appealed for 1 year unless the SS is proven to be something else.  
6. Any members who helped Dom in the late 2023 attempt, or tend to start/help any future Dom clans will be permanently banned with no chance of getting unbanned or pardoned, no matter what the reason for them helping or the duration of time they helped Dom.  
   - 6.1. Any clan that goes Dom in the future won't have its players instantly banned. A player has the chance to leave the clan before helping them to prevent getting banned.
   - 6.2. The 1 year unban request after perm ban won't apply to them as they cannot request an unban and will be reported to DECA support.  
7. **Scam:** 
   - 7.1. Instant temp ban for 3 days or until items returned.  
   - 7.2. Turns to perm ban if items are not returned.  
   - 7.3. If more than one scam occurs in quick succession, it is an instant perm ban. Council will decide to perm ban.  
8. **Drop Stealing:** 
   - 8.1. Instant temp ban for 3 days or until items returned.  
   - 8.2. Turns to perm ban if items are not returned.  
   - 8.3. If more than one theft occurs in quick succession, it is an instant perm ban. Council will decide to perm ban.  
9. Don't kill steal mobs from other players (quickly killing a target that someone else is moving in to attack). Doing so is rude and gives the Epona community the right to temporarily ban the offender if it becomes a repeated offense. Respect other people's lixing (the most common way of leveling) areas; if someone is lixing, don't lix up and try to take the mobs from them.  
10. The following rules are unchangeable and cannot be voted out of the system or edited/altered:  
    - 10.1. No IRL trading  
    - 10.2. No account trading/sharing  
    - 10.3. No scamming  
    - 10.4. No consistent kill stealing/griefing  
    - 10.5. No Dom attempts  
    - 10.6. Common sense + server vote to decide  

Epona reserves the right to server ban an individual for the following reasons: 
- Scamming 
- Breaking official DECA TOS 
- Breaking any rule voted for and accepted by server majority (Rules in this doc) 
- Double Rolling / Dual Dicing 
- Severe Kill Stealing 
- Additional reasons may be stated elsewhere in the doc.

**DISCLAIMER:** Any mention of a "ban" refers to a server ban where an individual is excluded from participating in bosses and other activities on the server. Epona majority approves all bans directly (by vote) or through indirect means (Epona rules) and is responsible for enforcing them. Please see Epona Rules in the Epona subforum for reference. Any mention of a "ban" above does not refer to a ban from DECA and does not represent the opinion of DECA or DECA policy.

## How Does Voting Work?
Votes can be initiated by anyone. State a discussion topic in a general chat group and collect 30 "sponsors" for the idea to go to a vote. This means they must get 30 individuals who support (or are against the idea but want a vote) the idea and make a list of their names. The topic must be discussed for at least 48 hours in a general chat room before a vote is started. This list can be shared with a voting chatroom admin, and a vote shall then commence for 48 hours unless stated otherwise beforehand. The sponsors may and regularly are contacted to ensure validity of their sponsorship. Any vote with invalid or forged sponsors will be halted immediately and all votes deemed null and void.

1. The same vote or any topic regarding a vote can only be voted again after a 6-month cooldown. Votes which have anything to do with the previous vote and are able to affect it in any way are also included; those will have to wait until the cooldown is over, then the vote can be held. Starting Jan 12, 2025, the cooldown on gear changes will now have a 3-month cooldown. All other topics remain with a 6-month cooldown.  
2. Votes can only be proposed in a +1 and -1 format (-1 being a default reject option).  
3. Votes can only be recalled (canceled) within 1 hour from the vote start time AND can only be recalled once. To do so, a request from the vote author must be placed within the hour that the vote started.  
4. Emergency votes can occur in cases where DECA updates something that we need to adapt immediately to. With these votes, the discussion time AND the same previous vote waiting time will be omitted. Only one emergency vote on the same topic AND update will be allowed; otherwise, the previous vote waiting time still applies.  
5. Voting eligibility runs in parallel to bossing requirements; you must meet the bossing requirements to vote on a topic regarding that specific boss. For example, to vote on a topic regarding necro, you must be level 200+ and have DL. In general votes (bans, chatroom administration, general rules, etc.), you must be level 200 at minimum to be eligible to vote.  
6. Any tampering/rigging of any kind of vote will result in a perm ban. Violation will be determined by the general population. Examples of tampering/rigging can include: coercing/forcing a particular vote out of an individual, tricking an individual to vote in a particular way, shaming/causing embarrassment on someone for voting a particular way, failing to forward an individual's vote if it is not the desired outcome you intended, and anything else deemed as malicious by the general population.  
7. Sponsors must be eligible to vote in order to sponsor the vote. Sponsors must be made aware of the exact wording and purpose of the vote. If either changes, a reconfirmation of sponsorship must be obtained. All sponsors must meet the level requirements of the topic. For example, only level 200+ can sponsor a vote for necro, only level 220+ can sponsor something for gele, and a general topic would have a level 200 requirement on it.  
8. A vote can only pass by a vast majority of 60%. For example: if 100 people vote, at least 60% need to say yes in order for a vote to pass.  
9. All additional voted-in gear changes will only be effective 2 weeks after the close of their respective vote.  
10. Proposals/votes for gear changes: Entire sections of gears can't be changed in one Proposal/vote. Each class AND all end game boss drops will have their own separate votes.

## What to Keep in Mind When Bossing
Generally, when an issue arises at a boss, it is the "Main Tank's" responsibility to clear the issue. With that said, the server community has veto power for all MT decisions.

**HOST RULE:**  
Any host (MT, killer, or anyone else hosting drops) who abuses this role (with proof) in any way (like... not rolling people without proof, does not abide by Epona rules, or acts in a biased manner) will face consequences. 

**Consequences for Host Abuse:**
1. **First offense:** 
   - 1.1. Official warning listed in discussion thread. 
   - 1.2. Not allowed to host at any boss for 3 days.  
2. **Second offense:** 
   - 2.1. Temp ban for 3 days. 
   - 2.2. Also noted in the warning list.    
3. **Third or more offenses:** More serious consequences that will be decided by the community by a vote. During this time, they will not be allowed to host at any boss until the vote concludes.

Some bosses are designated as All-roll while others are class-roll. 

**Boss Mechanics:**
1. Epona is a free server; to decide on who gets what drop, we roll after the boss dies. Rolls occur at the closest leystone or on spot after the boss dies (the latter is mostly for legacy bosses), the MT will decide. The highest rolls get drops. The highest rolling player picks the first drop, the second highest gets the next pick, and so on. If players roll a number that ties with another, they will re-roll.  
2. When a boss dies (unless only one group is present), the drops will go to the main tank. He/she will shout what the drops are and then proceed to announce "All Roll" if it is an All-Roll boss or will shout a specific class to roll such as "Rogue" if it is a class-roll. If the boss contains both class and all roll items, the tank usually performs the all roll first, notes who won the item(s), and gives out the drop(s).  
3. To participate in any boss, your level must be at least within 10 levels of the said boss's level. (Ex: Cragskor is level 205; to participate and earn a roll, you must be at least level 195).  
4. Your character must be geared with equipment that will be effective at killing the boss. 
   - 4.1. If your gear is not appropriate, another player can ask for you to be "no-rolled," meaning your roll will not count for that boss if the majority present agrees that you are not geared fairly.  
5. Bosses such as Gele drop items that are both class-specific (druid totem) and those that are free to be used by anyone. 
   - 5.1. When rolling for your class, you will roll (when directed by the MT) for the class-restricted items of the class you called for. 
   - 5.2. You can only roll for ONE class each boss fight.  
6. For class bosses: If an item drops and there are no players of the particular class at the boss (or if no players called that class), then the item will be subjected to an all-roll.  
7. At "All Roll" bosses, you may ONLY ROLL ONCE. 
   - 7.1. At Class Roll Bosses, you may roll twice if there is a drop of your class and an all-roll item.  
8. When the main tank pulls/starts the boss, everyone near the boss is on time; all others will be considered late and will not receive a roll.  
9. Anyone late to any boss and still rolls anyway will face consequences. If caught with proper proof of sneaking into a boss and rolling in an attempt to steal, the consequences are as follows:  
   - 9.1. First offense: warning.  
   - 9.2. Second offense: 1 week ban.  
   - 9.3. Third offense: 1 month ban.  
   - 9.4. Fourth offense: 1 year ban.  
   - 9.5. Fifth offense: perm ban forever.  
10. If a player in a lock group decides to unfairly take a drop (steals), a winner is later determined to have been unqualified, or the main tank runs off with a drop, a discussion will take place to determine the rightful winner of the drop. 
    - 10.1. Once this discussion is complete and the winner has been determined, the person obtaining the drop will receive a temp ban for three days. 
    - 10.2. If this individual returns the drop within those three days, the temp ban will be lifted. 
    - 10.3. If this individual fails to return the drop within those three days, the temp ban will convert to a perma ban.  
11. This rule will apply to all 5-6* bosses where the MT sees it fit.  
    - 11.1. Whenever a boss is locked, the lock group has to announce itself. 
        - 11.1.1. If, after a minute of the boss being locked, no one speaks up, the tank calls the lock group. 
        - 11.1.2. If no one replies, the MT has the right to call everyone to back off and reset the boss. 
        - 11.1.3. If a certain group of players fails to do so, they will be warned, and next offenses will be a temp ban of 1 month for all its players.  
   
    - 11.2. When the lock group announces itself, if someone outside of the group trolls and shouts a fake call (if he claims he was in lock and wasn't just to let his friends secretly lock group), he will be no rolled from this boss. 
        - 11.2.1. The second offense is a temp ban of 1 month.  
   
    - 11.3. If the lock group fails to post SS more than once or breaks rules 11.1 and 11.2, the MT has the right to send someone on his behalf to join this lock group (if they locked) and ensure SS is taken.  
12. If there is only one group present, then no one will roll, unless it's a class boss in which case players will still roll for the items of their class. Otherwise, the drops will remain with the players they drop on.  
13. All participants must adhere to the gear requirements guide when attending EG bosses (Prot, Gele, BT, Dhio, etc). The gear requirements guide can be found in the No roll gear list.  
14. Dual logging more than one toon is always helpful. Feel free to do so, but two participating toons do not mean you get two rolls. Anyone caught double rolling / dual dicing on toons will be permanently banned. You only have the ability to earn one roll.  
15. If you are online, you must roll for yourself unless you disconnect and someone else has already rolled for you. If you disconnect or have to leave before rolls are started, someone can roll for you.  
16. Do not under any circumstances invite banned players to your boss groups. Server banned players are banned for a reason; they aren't allowed to participate in any bosses.  

### Audit Rule: Established August 16, 2024
With this proposed rule, players can formally request an explanation for suspicious gear obtained by a player acquired in unreasonable timing, including gaining DG or OP gears within weeks.

1. The OP will provide screenshots of quickly obtained high-tier gear, and once 30 sponsors have been gathered, the accused must explain their acquisition of gear with proof and/or vouchers.  
2. Once the accused has explained (or failed to explain), a vote will commence on whether the explanation is sufficient and fair.  
3. If the ban vote passes, the accused will be added to the ban list and cannot appeal until they have provided an explanation with proof and/or vouchers.  
4. Punishment to harassers: In regards to situations where some players intended to mock or lower the reputation of the person using this rule, after reasonable proof or reason has been provided by the defendant. If they continue to harass or intend to audit him/her, the harasser needs to be submitted to council with proof of the harassment by the defendant.  
    - 4.1. The harasser first gets a warning, and then a 2-week ban for the second offense.  
    - 4.2. Finally, a permanent ban (one year appeal restriction) for the third offense before they could submit an appeal to the Discord server.

Concerning the consequences for: IRL Trading, scams, drop steals, and account sharing or selling are listed in the "General Rules" section above... The length of temp bans can be altered on a case-by-case basis if Council deems it. If someone gets a permanent ban but then appeals the ban and gets unbanned, they do not default back to their first offense, as in - any next offense is still a permanent ban.
